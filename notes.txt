TODO
- replace Observer.sampleChan with a pool or shared slice of slices
 - both of these alternatives should be faster than sending each sample through a channel
 - would need to be balanced with the additional synchronization needed for pool/slice recirculation
 - let user choose sizes, as well as provide good defaults
 
- provide analysis functionality, to potentially allow sample processing in the same thread for light processing
 - could be also used to discover good parameters for the target system/sample function
 
- provide option for sampling only under certain conditions (ex. every N, or any other custom condition)

- make a tool to automatically remove obs code for production builds
 - remove some but not all?
